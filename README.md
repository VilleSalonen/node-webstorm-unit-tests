Unit testing Node with WebStorm
===============================

I come from a Java and C# background so I'm used to writing, testing and
debugging software in my IDE. WebStorm in my opinion is an outstanding web IDE
and it was my first choice when I started writing JavaScript and Node software.

I didn't have a clue on how to start writing testable software but after my
bumping my head around a couple of times I finally found that Node and Mocha
made quite a good pair and they were easy to integrate with WebStorm.

When I wrote this boilerplate, I used [Glenn Block's "Debugging mocha unit tests
with WebStorm step by step"](http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2013/01/17/debugging-mocha-unit-tests-with-webstorm-step-by-step/)
article as a basis for configuring WebStorm.
